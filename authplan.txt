Proposed Changes
1. Auth Context (src/context/AuthContext.jsx) [NEW]
Create context to store user object { name, email, role }.
Implement login(email, password) and signup(name, email, password, role) functions.
Mock logic:
Admin credentials: admin@gov.in / admin123 (Role: 'admin')
User credentials: user@gov.in / user123 (Role: 'user')
Persist login state using localStorage.
2. Auth Page (src/pages/Auth.jsx) [NEW]
Tabbed interface: [Login] | [Signup].
Login Form: Email, Password.
Signup Form: Name, Email, Password, Role Selection (Dropdown: User/Admin for demo purposes).
Style using existing Glassmorphism and Dark Mode variables.
3. Route Protection (src/components/layout/ProtectedRoute.jsx) [NEW]
Wrapper component to check user and role.
Redirect to /auth if not logged in.
Redirect to / if logged in but insufficient permissions.
4. App Integration (
src/App.jsx
)
Wrap 
App
 with AuthProvider.
Add /auth route.
Protect /dashboard route (Admin only).
5. Navbar Updates (
src/components/layout/Navbar.jsx
)
Show "Login" button if guest.
Show User Profile/Logout if logged in.
Verification Plan
Signup Flow:
Register as a new user.
Verify redirection to Home.
Login Flow:
Login as Admin -> Verify access to Dashboard.
Login as User -> Verify access denied to Dashboard (if attempted).
Logout:
Verify user state is cleared.
